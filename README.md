# 🗺️ GraphHopper Enhanced Route Finder with Map UI

This Python project is an **interactive route-finding tool** that integrates the [GraphHopper API](https://www.graphhopper.com/) to calculate routes between two locations.  
It provides **step-by-step directions**, **distance and duration summaries**, and an **interactive map visualization** powered by **Folium**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 **Geocoding Integration** – Converts location names (e.g., "Batangas, Philippines") into coordinates using the GraphHopper Geocoding API.  
- 🛣️ **Route Calculation** – Computes optimal driving routes and provides travel distance and estimated time.  
- 📏 **Unit Conversion** – Displays results in kilometers or miles.  
- 💬 **Interactive CLI** – Colorized console interface using `colorama` for better readability.  
- 📋 **Formatted Output** – Tabulated results and clear step-by-step navigation instructions.  
- 🗺️ **Map Visualization** – Automatically generates an **interactive HTML map** (`route_map.html`) showing your route and markers for start and end points.  
- 💾 **File Saving Option** – Exports your route summary to `route_summary.txt`.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user inputs a start and destination location.  
2. The script uses **GraphHopper Geocoding API** to get latitude and longitude.  
3. The **Routing API** retrieves the path, distance, and travel time.  
4. The program displays:
   - A formatted summary of distance and estimated duration  
   - Optional turn-by-turn directions  
   - A generated `route_map.html` file with an interactive map visualization
